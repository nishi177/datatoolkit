        "6.What are the differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists\n",
        "\n",
        "   NumPy arrays and Python lists differ in several key aspects. NumPy arrays are significantly faster because they are implemented in C and use fixed, contiguous memory blocks, making them more memory-efficient. In contrast, Python lists store references to objects, which increases memory usage. NumPy arrays support vectorized operations, allowing element-wise computations without explicit loops, whereas Python lists require loops for similar operations, making them slower. Additionally, NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements must be of the same data type, while Python lists can store mixed data types. NumPy also provides built-in mathematical functions, making it more suitable for numerical and scientific computations compared to standard Python lists.\n",

        "\n",
        "   Closing a file in Python is important to ensure proper resource management and data integrity. When a file is opened, the operating system allocates resources to handle it, and failing to close the file can lead to memory leaks or file corruption. Closing a file ensures that all written data is properly saved to disk, preventing data loss or incomplete writes. It also allows other programs or processes to access the file, as some files remain locked until they are closed. A best practice is to use the with open() statement, which automatically closes the file after execution, eliminating the need for manual closure and reducing the risk of errors\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n",
